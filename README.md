# dotnetcore_react_signalr_lab_repo
A Lab repository with dotnet core 3.X, React 16 and SignalR. 

In order to start quick this is made from the template code given by running `dotnet new react` command.

The purpose with this repository is to start labbing with the SignalR library. 

It contains a very simple chat that will send messages to the connected clients in real time (no page reload is needed).

It also contains a simple example how to monitor the status of long running tasks executed in the C# backend.
